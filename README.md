# condenscss
This is an experimental project for converting CSS to Sass/SCSS.

Existing CSS to Sass/SCSS converters poorly condense output by failing to merge all mergeable selectors. This project aims to take CSS input and output well-structured Sass/SCSS with optional variable replacement and stripping of 
non-styling properties.
